Developed on Cloud9
Utlized Private Pub, Thin and Devise as three main gems for this app.

Here is a sample chat app where the users need to be authenticated, have a profile, and be able to chat with another user. 
Currently most of the code is up for this app, but the routing needs to reworked to get the app to view properly. 
In the meantime, this app is intended to be a code sample for Ruby on Rails.
